Refactoring National Weather Service driver

üîç API Context:

The National Weather Service APIs are REST APIs that use hypermedia as a form of navigation (HATEOAS ‚Äì Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State). The National Weather Service (NWS) API follows this pattern.

In this model, URL chains need to be called one by one, which is a problem for the driver structure, since some APIs contain important data for calling another API, requiring data synchronicity.

Another characteristic is the total lack of a standard in data distribution. Depending on the city and/or location, the data does not follow a pattern (for example, data every 1 hour, but when reading there is data every 6 hours, another with 2 hours between data, etc. The structure also differs between current, 1-hour, 12-hour and daily data, requiring changes in the way this data is called to assign it to the script objects.

üß© Technical Challenges Encountered;

  * Asynchronous Dependency:
      The original format of desklet.js makes parallel asynchronous calls;
      This prevented the use of data from API1 (Location) as input for others APIs;

  * Fragmented Data:
      ** The APIs return additional information:
      	  ** First API return others APIS URLs ;
          ** Current conditions did not have complete data (use two APIs: current and 1 hour);
          ** Forecast data in two APIs (12 hour and daily) ;

      ** Premature assignment to objects caused:
          ** Data loss or overwritten during translations (desklet.js is not designed for this kind of out-of-sequence data assignment);
          ** Inconsistencies in rendering, mainly affecting the translation of out-of-sequence passages;

      ** User Experience:
    
          ** The emptyData ‚Üí fetch ‚Üí fill process created:
    
              ** Noticeable "no data screen" windows;
              ** Flickering in the interface;
              

üí° Implemented Solutions:

    1. Flow Control with Async/Await:
        ** Benefits:
              ** Ensures correct order of execution;
              ** Maintains compatibility with original desklet.js and wxbase.js

    2. Data Processing Reengineering:
        ** Phase 1: Collection and parsing (without attribution);
        ** Phase 2: Unification of supplementary data;
        ** Phase 3: Unique attribution to objects;
        ** Improvement: Eliminated inconsistencies in final data;

    3. Update Cycle Optimization
        ** emptyData moved to after new data is fetched;

    * Result:
        ** Total reduction in error screen time (between updates);
        ** Smooth transition between updates;

New driver (star changelogs)

* Insert 5 APIs to extract data;

* Extract forecast data for date and conditions to exibition correct data;

* refreshData in sincronous mode (async/await);

* Extract correct icons and weathertex to exibition;
