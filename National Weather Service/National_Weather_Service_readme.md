üîç API Context:

The National Weather Service APIs are REST APIs that use hypermedia as a form of navigation (HATEOAS ‚Äì Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State). The National Weather Service (NWS) API follows this pattern.

In this model, URL chains need to be called one by one, which is a problem for the driver structure, since some APIs contain important data for calling another API, requiring data synchronicity.

Another characteristic is the total lack of a standard in data distribution. Depending on the city and/or location, the data does not follow a pattern (for example, data every 1 hour, but when reading there is data every 6 hours, another with 2 hours between data, etc. The structure also differs between current, 1-hour, 12-hour and daily data, requiring changes in the way this data is called to assign it to the script objects.

üß© Technical Challenges Encountered;

  * Asynchronous Dependency:
      The original format of desklet.js makes parallel asynchronous calls;
      This prevented the use of data from API1 (Location) as input for others APIs;

  * Fragmented Data:
      ** The APIs return additional information:
      	  ** First API return others APIS URLs ;
          ** Current conditions did not have complete data (use two APIs: current and 1 hour);
          ** Forecast data in two APIs (12 hour and daily) ;

      ** Premature assignment to objects caused:
          ** Data loss or overwritten during translations (desklet.js is not designed for this kind of out-of-sequence data assignment);
          ** Inconsistencies in rendering, mainly affecting the translation of out-of-sequence passages;

      ** User Experience:
    
          ** The emptyData ‚Üí fetch ‚Üí fill process created:
    
              ** Noticeable "no data screen" windows;
              ** Flickering in the interface;
              

üí° Implemented Solutions:

    1. Flow Control with Async/Await:
        ** Benefits:
              ** Ensures correct order of execution;
              ** Maintains compatibility with original desklet.js and wxbase.js

    2. Data Processing Reengineering:
        ** Phase 1: Collection and parsing (without attribution);
        ** Phase 2: Unification of supplementary data;
        ** Phase 3: Unique attribution to objects;
        ** Improvement: Eliminated inconsistencies in final data;

    3. Update Cycle Optimization
        ** emptyData moved to after new data is fetched;

    * Result:
        ** Total reduction in error screen time (between updates);
        ** Smooth transition between updates;

Update 2025-06-01

1. Removed bug that displayed data when user input was null or wrong after already acquiring data:

* Inserted in _verifyStation the _emptyData function to clear data previously obtained when the user changes or deletes the stationID data;

2. Modified _verifyStation function:

* Modified the latitude, longitude check allowing the use of space after the comma in the regex;

![Regex verifyStation](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/stationID3.png)

* Added verification of entered coordinates (if null or within valid geographic coordinate values);

![LatLon verification](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/stationID4.png)

3. New messages to inform the user of errors when entering coordinates:

* "Error: Location is empty or not definded.";

![error verifyStation](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/stationID0.png)

* "Error: Invalid Location format. Expected: latitude,longitude (e.g. 40.71,-74.01)";

![error verifyStation](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/stationID1.png)

* "Error: Invalid latitude or longitude values in Location "

4. Correction in the assignment of data to objects by "object.assign" in the parse forecast function;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update 2025-05-31

* Reverted _mapIcon to previous version where comments were recovered;

* Created description list of texts provided in NWS API (_mapDescription);

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update 2025-05-30

1. Code optimization:

* Replacing the load APIs functions with the _loadData and _loadDataWithParams functions;

* Script cleaning and standardization;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update 2025-05-29 (Refatored Code)

I will detail all the changes I made to make the code simpler and more compact, while maintaining the same functionality:
1. Organization and Constants

* Consolidation of constants: I grouped all the constants at the beginning of the file for better visibility:

![Consolidation of constants](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/image1.png)

* Centralized mappings: I created constant objects for icon and text mappings:

![Centralized mappings](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/image2.png)

2. Simplifying Methods

* _emptyData(): I replaced the manual initialization with a more compact structure:

![emptyData](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/image3.png)

* refreshData():

    I used Promise.all to load the data in parallel;

    I simplified the error handling logic;

3. Helper Improvements

* _getWeatherAsync(): Made more concise:

![getWeatherAsync](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/image4.png)

* _mapIcon() and _mapDescription(): Simplified using mapping objects:

![Mapping Objects](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/image5.png)

4. Simplified Status Handling

* I've consolidated status updates into more straightforward operations:

![Status Handling](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/image6.png)

5. ES6+ (ECMAScript 6) Syntax Improvements

* Destructuring assignment:

![Destructuring assignment](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/image7.png)

* Ternary operators:

![Ternary operator](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/image8.png)

* Optional chaining:

![Chaining](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/image9.png)

6. Reduced Repetitive Code

* Eliminated similar methods (_params and _params0) by consolidating them into conditional logic;

* Replaced for loops with array methods like slice() and fill();

7. Consistent Naming

* Standardized method names to camelCase (_parseLocation instead of _parse_location);

* Kept the underscore prefix convention for private methods;

8. Unified Error Handling

* Created a consistent pattern for error handling across all asynchronous operations;

* Simplified updating of error state;

9. Operational Efficiency

* Parallelized requests with Promise.all;

* Reduced unnecessary copy and assignment operations;

10. Improved Readability

* Shortened complex conditional blocks;

* Used Object.assign for multiple assignments;

* Removed obvious comments (code explains itself)

11. The entire function of determining the correct day for forecasts has been revised and simplified. Since the API does not provide well-organized data, the code section has been commented to clarify possible future interventions.

All these changes kept exactly the same same original functionality, but resulted in approximately 50% smaller code that is much easier to maintain and understand.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update 2025-05-28

* Adjustment in the _getDayName function for correct display of the days of the week of the forecasts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New driver (star changelogs)

* Insert 5 APIs to extract data;

* Extract forecast data for date and conditions to exibition correct data;

* refreshData in sincronous mode (async/await);

* Extract correct icons and weathertex to exibition;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
