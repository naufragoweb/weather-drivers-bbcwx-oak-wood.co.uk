🔍 API Context:

	The Open-Meteo API does not provide location data. A new API has been introduced to fetch location data reported by the Open-Meteo API.
	
	
🧩 Technical Challenges Encountered;

1. Location data (meta) not provided by Open-Meteo;

2. Name of days in future forecast incorrectly designated;

3. Weather condition icons not correctly assigned to the list of icons in the system;

4. Part of the code for describing weather conditions together with the display icons;


💡 Implemented Solutions:

1. Addition of new API (https://geocode.xyz/) to provide location data (meta) to the driver;

2.  Flow Control with Async/Await:

        ** Benefits:
        
              -- Ensures correct order of execution --> For the new location API, latitude and longitude data is required, which may be different from the data entered by the user, avoiding errors in assigning the wrong location in relation to the data provided. The synchronicity of the execution allows the data to be waited for and used correctly, regardless of errors, delays or any other incident in the search for data via the Internet.
              
              -- Maintains compatibility with original desklet.js and wxbase.js
              
3. Code restructuring. Separation of functions with grouping of sections, for cleaner and easier to maintain code;

4. Update Cycle Optimization

        ** emptyData moved to after new data is fetched;
        
5.  New getDayName function based on the date provided in the API to determine the day of the week corresponding to the displayed data.

6. Separation of texts and icons, each in its respective function (mapicon and mapDescription) to organize the code.

Update 2025-05-31 (Refatored Code):

1. Organization and Constants

* Consolidation of constants: I grouped all the constants at the beginning of the file for better visibility:

![Consolidation of constants](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/image1.png)

* Centralized mappings: I created constant objects for icon and text mappings:

2. Simplifying Methods

* _emptyData(): I replaced the manual initialization with a more compact structure:

![emptyData](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/image3.png)

* refreshData():

    I used Promise.all to load the data in parallel;

    I simplified the error handling logic;

3. Helper Improvements

* _getWeatherAsync(): Made more concise and insert Agent User:

4. Simplified Status Handling

* I've consolidated status updates into more straightforward operations:

![Status Handling](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/image6.png)

5. ES6+ (ECMAScript 6) Syntax Improvements

* Destructuring assignment:

![Destructuring assignment](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/image7.png)

* Ternary operators:

![Ternary operator](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/image8.png)

* Optional chaining:

![Chaining](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/image9.png)

6. Reduced Repetitive Code

* Replaced for loops with array methods like slice() and fill();

* Removed similar methods ( APIs load ) by consolidating them into conditional logic;

![APIs load](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/image12.png)

7. Consistent Naming

* Standardized method names to camelCase (_parseLocation instead of _parse_location);

* Kept the underscore prefix convention for private methods;

8. Unified Error Handling

* Created a consistent pattern for error handling across all asynchronous operations;

* Simplified updating of error state;

9. Operational Efficiency

* Parallelized requests with Promise.all;

* Reduced unnecessary copy and assignment operations;

10. Improved Readability

* Shortened complex conditional blocks;

* Used Object.assign for multiple assignments;

* Removed obvious comments (code explains itself)

11. Removed the Geocode API to use the Open Street Map Nominatim API:

* Limit of 1 call per second;

* Removed delay function in API call;

12. Separation of params for each API:

* When the getWeather function is called, each corresponding params is loaded;

13. Separation of the parse of objects (current, meta and forecast) into distinct functions:

* Concurrent execution between wall functions with Promise All;

![Concurrent parse](https://github.com/naufragoweb/weather-drivers-bbcwx-oak-wood.co.uk/blob/main/%20Z-%20Images/image13.png)

14. Insert new icon (openmeteo.png) for insertion in /5.4/icons/colorful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update 2025-05-27

* Insert time delimiter for calls to geocode.xyz API (only allows one call per minute)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Update 2025-05-22 - Start new script

* Add new API to location data;

* Refatored code;

* Control flow with async/await;

* Inclusion of missing data;

* minor adjustments and code cleanup.
